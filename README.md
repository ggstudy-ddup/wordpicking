# TOEFL Word Pick for Honor Students (Version 0.1)

This program is used for picking some words randomly from a big word list in a
*.docx* file, output as a *.txt* file.

You can choose a file of any location on your disk, as an input file.
But, the file will export on your *Desktop*, for this version (V0.1)

You can choose how many words would you want for the output file. If there is
no enough words in the list for the program to pick, the output file will be a
random version of the input file. 

Also, you can choose how to separate those words, written in *C-style string*,
with *escape characters*. The default separation is *"\n"*.
